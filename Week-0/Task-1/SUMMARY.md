***Summary of the Video "DIGITAL VLSI DESIGN SOC AND PLANNING"***

In the video Sir Kunal Ghosh addressed about the flow of chip making.From where it starts how we build.
It starts from getting the specifications from the customer then writing and compiling a C file.Checking
the C file by applying testbench cases and see whether it is functionally equivalent.After that step we write 
verilog code do timing analysis with the help of OpenSTA.Do placement and routing.Getting a GDS file which is 
used for masking the design into chips.Sir also showed some of the development boards.
